# Skin_Tone_Classification
Project Overview In this project, I developed a skin tone classification model to classify images into different skin tone categories: dark, light, lighten, mid dark, mid light, mid-dark, and mid-light. The model uses Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to achieve high accuracy and is deployed using Flask to create an interactive web application.
